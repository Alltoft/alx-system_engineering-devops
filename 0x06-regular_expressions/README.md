# Regular Expression

Regular Expression, also known as regex, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is used to match and manipulate text. 

## Syntax

The syntax of regular expressions is based on a combination of literal characters and metacharacters. Literal characters are the normal characters that make up the text, while metacharacters are special characters that have a specific meaning. 

## Examples

Here are some examples of regular expressions:

- `^hello`: matches any string that starts with "hello".
- `world$`: matches any string that ends with "world".
- `^hello world$`: matches the exact string "hello world".
- `[0-9]+`: matches any string that contains one or more digits.
- `.*`: matches any string of any length.

## Usage

Regular expressions are used in many programming languages, text editors, and command-line tools. They are used for tasks such as searching, replacing, and validating text.
